Build a remote system.

This gem is currently in pre-alpha planning and will not work. As such
I'll include a few sample blueprints to give an idea as to what I'm
after with this project.

The general goal here is to have a quick and lightweight system for
defining how to install certain tasks on a remote server without going
to the notable extremes of something like Chef or other deployment
tools.
